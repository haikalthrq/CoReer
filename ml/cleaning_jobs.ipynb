    "**Alur Kerja Pembersihan:**\n",
    "1.  **Impor Library & Memuat Data:** Memuat library yang dibutuhkan dan dataset mentah secara fleksibel (bisa dari lokal atau Kaggle).\n",
    "2.  **Analisis & Pembersihan Data:** Melakukan serangkaian langkah pembersihan, termasuk:\n",
    "    * Mengganti nilai \"Not Found\" dengan NaN (Not a Number) agar mudah diolah.\n",
    "    * Menghapus data duplikat.\n",
    "    * Menghapus baris data yang tidak memiliki informasi esensial (`Job Description` atau `Job Requirements`).\n",
    "3.  **Penyimpanan Data Bersih:** Menyimpan hasil pembersihan ke dalam file `jobs_cleaned.csv`."
